## Post 1: Introduction/Launch Post

### Image Concept

You don't need a gym membership. You don't need fancy equipment. You just need to walk.

Just Walk is a new step tracking app designed for people who want to build a lasting walking habit - not optimize their marathon pace.

Here's what makes it different:

Stop losing your streak to bad luck. StreakGuard rescues your streak when your phone fails to sync. Streak Shields let you "pardon" the occasional missed day.

Walk smarter, not longer. Power Walk uses interval training (3 min easy, 3 min brisk) to burn 20% more calories in less time.

Works on your wrist. Full Apple Watch app that works without your phone.

## Post 2: Streak Protection Feature

### Image Concept
Split image showing:
- Left: Sad face with "Streak Lost: Sync Error"
- Right: Happy face with shield icon "Streak Protected"

### Caption
The worst feeling in fitness apps: Losing a 47-day streak because your phone didn't sync.

We've all been there. You did the work. You walked the steps. But technology failed you.

That's why we built StreakGuard.

Just Walk automatically detects when data sync issues would have broken your streak - and rescues it.

Plus, with Streak Shields, you can "pardon" the occasional day when life gets in the way. Because one missed day shouldn't erase a month of consistency.

Your effort deserves protection.

## Post 3: Power Walk Intervals

### Image Concept
Carousel post:
1. "What if you could burn 20% more calories in the same walk?"
2. Interval diagram: 3 min easy (blue) / 3 min brisk (orange)
3. Phone showing Power Walk countdown
4. "Download Just Walk - Link in bio"

### Caption
Walking is great. Interval walking is better.

Research shows alternating between easy and brisk walking burns significantly more calories than walking at a steady pace - and improves cardiovascular fitness faster.

Just Walk's Power Walk feature does the thinking for you:
- Audio and haptic cues tell you when to speed up and slow down
- Choose 18, 30, or 45 minute sessions
- Track your intervals automatically

No complicated settings. No fitness jargon. Just walk when it says walk, and speed up when it says go.

Try Power Walk free for 7 days.

## Post 4: Achievement System

21 badges. 3 categories. Infinite motivation.

Most step trackers just show you a number. Just Walk gives you something to work toward.

Consistency badges reward your daily streaks
Distance badges track your lifetime miles
Step badges celebrate your total steps walked

Each badge has multiple levels, so there's always a next milestone.

Which badge would you unlock first?
