# Just Walk - Blogger Outreach Templates

## Email Template 1: Health & Fitness Bloggers

**Subject:** New walking app for your readers (promo codes available)

---

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], the developer of Just Walk, a new iOS walking app focused on helping people build lasting walking habits.

I came across your article about [specific article topic] and thought your readers might find Just Walk useful, especially those just starting their fitness journey.

**What makes Just Walk different:**
- StreakGuard technology rescues streaks from sync failures (no more losing a 30-day streak to a glitch)
- Streak Shields let users "pardon" occasional missed days
- Power Walk feature uses interval training for better results in less time

I'd love to offer your readers free promo codes for a 3-month Pro trial.

No strings attached - just hoping to get the app in front of people who would genuinely benefit from it.

Would you be interested in trying it out?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's the App Store link if you want to check it out first: [link]

## Email Template 2: Apple Watch / Tech Reviewers

**Subject:** Walking app with full standalone Watch support - review opportunity

---

Hi [Name],

I noticed you cover Apple Watch apps and thought you might be interested in Just Walk - a new walking/fitness app with a full standalone Watch experience.

**Key points for Watch users:**
- Complete independence from iPhone during walks
- Watch complications for step tracking
- iCloud sync between devices
- Interval training with haptic cues on the wrist

The app is free to try, and I have promo codes for full Pro access if you'd like to do a review.

Let me know if you'd like more info or a demo.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## Email Template 3: Habit/Productivity Writers

**Subject:** App that uses "streak protection" to build walking habits

---

Hi [Name],

Your writing on [habit formation / productivity topic] resonated with me, so I wanted to share something I built.

Just Walk is a walking app specifically designed around habit science - particularly the power of streaks and the damage of "chain breaks."

**The key insight:** People abandon habits when they lose a streak, even if the streak was valuable. So I built two features to prevent that:

1. **StreakGuard** - Automatically rescues streaks broken by data sync failures
2. **Streak Shields** - Let users "pardon" occasional missed days without breaking their chain

The goal is to make the habit resilient to real life, not just track it.

Would love your thoughts, and happy to provide promo codes for your community.

Best,
[Your Name]
