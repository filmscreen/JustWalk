# Just Walk — Comprehensive Code Review Plan

## Objective

Perform a thorough code review of the Just Walk iOS app, identifying all bugs, design issues, performance problems, and areas for improvement. Produce an actionable report organized by severity and category.

---

## Instructions for Codex

You are reviewing the complete codebase for **Just Walk**, an iOS walking habit app. The app includes:

- **iOS App** (SwiftUI, iOS 15+)
- **watchOS App** (SwiftUI, watchOS 8+)
- **Widgets** (WidgetKit — Home screen and Lock screen)
- **HealthKit Integration** (steps, distance, heart rate, workouts)
- **StoreKit 2 Integration** (subscriptions)

Your task is to analyze every file and produce a comprehensive report covering bugs, design issues, and performance problems.

### 4. DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE ISSUES

Code quality and maintainability problems:

#### Architecture
- [ ] Massive view files (>500 lines) that should be split
- [ ] Business logic in views (should be in ViewModels)
- [ ] Tight coupling between components
- [ ] Missing dependency injection
- [ ] Singletons overused
- [ ] Circular dependencies
- [ ] No clear separation of concerns

#### State Management
- [ ] @State used where @StateObject should be
- [ ] @ObservedObject used where @StateObject should be
- [ ] Multiple sources of truth for same data
- [ ] State not properly scoped
- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders due to state structure

#### Data Flow
- [ ] Data passed through too many layers (prop drilling)
- [ ] Environment objects overused
- [ ] Combine publishers not properly managed
- [ ] Async/await not used where appropriate
- [ ] Completion handlers mixed with async/await

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Errors silently swallowed
- [ ] Generic catch blocks hiding specific errors
- [ ] No user-facing error messages
- [ ] No retry mechanisms
- [ ] No offline handling

#### Code Smells
- [ ] Duplicated code (DRY violations)
- [ ] Magic numbers/strings
- [ ] Overly complex functions (cyclomatic complexity)
- [ ] Deep nesting (>3 levels)
- [ ] Long parameter lists
- [ ] Dead code
- [ ] TODO/FIXME comments that should be addressed
- [ ] Commented-out code

**Report format:**
```

### 6. HEALTHKIT SPECIFIC REVIEW

HealthKit has strict requirements. Check:

- [ ] Authorization requested for all used types
- [ ] Authorization status checked before queries

- [ ] No API keys hardcoded
- [ ] No logging of sensitive health data
- [ ] StoreKit receipts validated properly
- [ ] No debug code in production
- [ ] App Transport Security configured

## Example Issue Report

```
🔴 CRITICAL: HealthKitManager.swift:142 — Force unwrap on optional HealthKit result

   Impact: App crashes if HealthKit query returns no data (e.g., new user with no step history)
   
   Problematic code:
   ```swift
   let steps = result.sumQuantity()!.doubleValue(for: .count())
   ```
   
   Fix:
   ```swift
   guard let sum = result.sumQuantity() else {
       self.todaySteps = 0
       return
   }
   let steps = sum.doubleValue(for: .count())
   ```
   
   Notes: This pattern appears in 3 other places in this file. Check lines 156, 178, 203.
```

```
🟠 HIGH: WorkoutManager.swift:89 — Workout session not ended when user force-quits app

   Impact: Orphaned workout sessions in HealthKit, incorrect calorie/time data
   
   Repro: 
   1. Start Fat Burn walk
   2. Force quit app (swipe up)
   3. Reopen app — workout still "running" in HealthKit
   
   Fix: Implement scene phase observer to end workout on .background or use 
   ExtendedRuntimeSession with proper cleanup in delegate methods.
```

```
⚡ PERFORMANCE: TodayView.swift:45 — HealthKit query in view body

   Impact: Query runs on every re-render, causing UI lag and battery drain
   
   Problematic code:
   ```swift
   var body: some View {
       VStack {
           Text("\(healthManager.fetchTodaySteps())")  // Called every render!
       }
   }
   ```
   
   Fix: Move fetch to onAppear or use @Published property that updates on schedule:
   ```swift
   .onAppear {
       healthManager.fetchTodaySteps()
   }
   ```
```

## Notes

- Focus on issues that affect the USER, not just code style preferences
- Prioritize issues that could cause App Store rejection
- HealthKit and StoreKit issues are especially important (Apple reviews these closely)
- Watch for any demo/mock/fake data that shouldn't ship in production
- Flag any TODO/FIXME comments that indicate known issues
- If you find patterns of issues, note the pattern rather than listing each instance
