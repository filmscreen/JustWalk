| 2 | "Your {X}-day streak needs you" | "A short walk can keep it alive." | ✅ Keep | ✅ Keep | Good — gentle, not demanding |
| 3 | "Walk paused" | "Looks like you're moving too fast. Open the app to resume." | ✅ Keep | "Looks like you sped up. Open the app when you're ready." | "Moving too fast" could feel judgmental; "when you're ready" is more patient |
| 4 | "Still walking?" | "We haven't detected movement. Open the app if you're still going." | ✅ Keep | ✅ Keep | Neutral check-in |
| 5 | "🎉 Rank Up!" | "You're now a {rank}. '{motto}'" | ✅ Keep | ✅ Keep | Celebration |
| 6 | "Legacy Badge Earned" | "Your {X}-day streak is immortalized in {name}." | ✅ Keep | ✅ Keep | Strong identity language |
| 7 | "Goal Achieved!" | "Congratulations! You've reached your daily step goal." | "Goal reached!" | "You did it. 🎉" | Current is robotic/corporate; shorter is warmer |
| 8 | "Shields Running Low" | "You have {X} shield(s) left. Don't miss your goal!" | "Shields Running Low" | "You have {X} shield(s) left this month." | "Don't miss your goal!" is pressure/shame-adjacent; neutral info is enough |

## 11. Red-Flag Summary

### 🔴 "Tracked" — 24 occurrences

**Location**: `ChallengeLibrary.swift` — every walk-count challenge uses "tracked walks."

**Fix**: Replace "Complete {X} tracked walks" → "Go on {X} walks" across all 12 months.

This is the single most impactful change. "Tracked" contradicts the app's promise of being a quiet partner.

### 🟡 "Track" / "Tracking" — 1 occurrence

**Location**: `SettingsView.swift` line 289 — "Step Tracking" permission label.

**Fix**: "Step Tracking" → "Step Access"

### 🟡 "Complete" (task language) — ~15 occurrences

**Locations**: Challenge descriptions ("Complete 5 morning walks"), PostWalkSummaryView ("Walk Complete"), voice cues ("Interval complete"), ChallengesDetailView ("All Challenges Complete!").

**Fix**: Replace with softer alternatives per recommendations above.

### 🟡 "Hit" (aggressive) — 12 occurrences

**Location**: `ChallengeLibrary.swift` — "Hit your daily goal {X} times"

**Fix**: "Hit your daily goal" → "Reach your daily goal"

### 🟡 "Maintain" (effortful) — 6 occurrences

**Location**: `ChallengeLibrary.swift` — "Maintain a {X}-day streak"

**Fix**: "Maintain" → "Build" — growth-oriented rather than maintenance-oriented.

### 🟡 "At Risk" (anxiety) — 2 occurrences

**Locations**: `StreakCardView.swift`, `DynamicCardView.swift`

**Fix**: "Streak at risk" → "Keep it going?" / "Your streak could use a walk today."

### 🟡 "Missed" (shame) — 2 occurrences

**Locations**: `StreakCalendarView.swift` legend, `ShieldInfoView.swift`

**Fix**: "Missed" → "Rest Day" / "miss a day" → "rest days"

### 🟡 "Don't miss" (negative framing) — 1 occurrence

**Location**: `NotificationManager.swift` — "Don't miss your goal!"

**Fix**: Remove. Let the shield count speak for itself.

### 🟡 "Cancel" (abrupt) — 4 occurrences

**Locations**: `GoalPickerSheet.swift`, `IntervalPickerSheet.swift`, `IntervalPreFlightSheet.swift`, `StreakCalendarView.swift`

**Fix**: "Cancel" → "Not Now" for consistency with onboarding voice.

### ✅ No occurrences found

- "Log" — not used anywhere
- "Workout" — not used anywhere
- "Exercise" — not used anywhere
- "Failed" — not used anywhere
